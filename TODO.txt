# Airlock TODO

- [ ] test all known Airtable field types
- [ ] download snapshot as zip
- [ ] backup just one base or entire airlock-data collection
- [ ] fix wrong password error (i.e., username "a", blank password)
- [ ] fix logout (link from homepage doesn't actually log you out)
- [ ] move forms from list views to standalone pages
- [ ] deduplicate all of the page wrappers & breadcrumbs (use templating?)
- [ ] add spinner when "take new snapshot" is running
